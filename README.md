# Carl Kent Brydges

After twenty-one years at the Illinois Bell Telephone Company, he holds the
position of Division Traffic Engineer of North Division, Chicago. His department
is responsible for the field engineering of manual and dial system telephone equipment,
dealing with all the challenges and complexities of such a field.

## The disagreement
However, he was recently kidnapped by Dr. Victor Kahan, once a professor and engineer
who has since been exiled by his peers. Their long-standing feud stemmed from their disagreement over the spread of the dial system for telephony across the United States and the principles and ethics guiding technological advancement. Dr. Kahan had a PhD in Electrical Engineering from a top university, but his unethical practices in the development of high-power bridges led to his expulsion and subsequent fall from grace. His resentment toward HKN, which promotes ethics, character, and integrity in engineering, led him to target Brydges, an esteemed member of the society.
Now, locked in a compartment in Dr. Kahan‚Äôs dark laboratory, Brother Brydges can only
be saved by overcoming three technological challenges.

### üé≠ Challenge One: To bit or not to bit
First of all, write a program with an esoteric programming language -
one that Dr. Kahan would mock as the creation of the "tech unworthy". 

### üêç Challenge Two: The python biting itself
The second challenge requires creating a Python program simply printing "Hello World" in the console. The catch?
You have to make it the most convoluted e confusing you can, so that Dr. Kahan would waste
a lot of time trying to understant its purpose.

### üí° Challenge Three: The beauty of simplicity
As a final task, you have to simplify this boolean expression.
